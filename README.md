## Hi, I'm Eddie

Surf's up! Exciting time to build.

## Current interests

### Keeping up 
- AlphaSignal, Latent Space, Unsupervised Learning, etc
- A/B'ing the frontier model offerings as they duke it out for coding agent supremacy

### Workflow leverage 
- Tearing up and reinventing my workflow every week
- Ergonomics of steering async/semi-async dev agents
- git worktrees, codespaces, codex, devcontainers, tmux'ing claude code
- Repurposing CI/CD pipelines as agent runtimes and dynamic dev environments
- PM techniques for achieving greater parallelism without burning out

### Infra/frameworks 
- Combining CQRS and event sourcing patterns with Rails for agent-driven time-travel capabilities
- Getting to rough parity in Ruby vs. LangGraph et. al
- Crafting multi-tenant architectures and secure sandboxed environments with Neon, Dagger, etc.

### Speculation
- Adoption trajectories and their impact on token economies
- "Big Models" vs. "Engineered Workflows"â€”what truly delivers results?
